## TreasureKoii API

#### How to develop locally

1. Clone the Repository.
2. Create a virtual environment using ```python3 -m venv venv``` if you're using linux. For other os, the command will be different.
3. Activate the virtual environment using ```source venv/bin/activate``` if you're using linux.
4. Make sure you're in the directory where ```api``` folder is in.
5. Run ```python manage.py runserver``` to run the server.

The server will be running in port 8000, unless there's something else already running in that port.
